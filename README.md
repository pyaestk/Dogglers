# Dogglers
Android basics with Kotlin(Unit 2)

Building the layouts for the recycler view cards, and then implementing the adapter so that each item is populated with the information about each dog. </br>
Note: This is the project with starter code (my part: implementing adapter for recyclerView, and UI )
